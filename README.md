Medical Computer application called "Attention Bias Modification Treatment":
A Windows-based application to support the study of Attention Bias Modification Treatment (ABMT)
in a randomized-controlled framework. The application was implemented using Python and Tkinter for the
graphical user interface (GUI). Designed as a psychological experiment, it assesses user reaction times
based on emotional stimulus. The program presents users with paired images or words depicting faces with positive,
negative, and neutral expressionsâ€”such as happy, angry, or neutral facial expressions(same with words).
Following each image, an arrow appears pointing either to the left or right, and the user indicates the direction
by pressing the corresponding arrow key (< or >) on the keyboard (changed to N & M based on clients request).
The application records response times for each trial and various calculations and analyses are performed on the
collected data to evaluate patterns in reaction speed based on the preceding emotional stimulus.
